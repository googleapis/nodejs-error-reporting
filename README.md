## Overview

This module provides Stackdriver Error Reporting support for Node.js applications.
[Stackdriver Error Reporting](https://cloud.google.com/error-reporting/) is a feature of
Google Cloud Platform that allows in-depth monitoring and viewing of errors reported by
applications running in almost any environment.

![Stackdriver Error Reporting overview](doc/images/errors-overview.png)

Here's an introductory video that provides some more details:

[![Learn about Error Reporting in Stackdriver](https://img.youtube.com/vi/cVpWVD75Hs8/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVpWVD75Hs8)

Note that [@google-cloud/logging-winston][logging-winston] and
[@google-cloud/logging-bunyan][logging-bunyan] automatically integrate with the
Error Reporting service for Error objects logged at severity `error` or higher,
for applications running on Google Cloud Platform. If you are already using
Winston or Bunyan in your application, and don't need direct access/control of
error reporting, you may want to check those modules as well.

## Quickstart

### Before you begin

1.  Select or create a Cloud Platform project.

    [Go to the projects page][projects]

1.  Enable billing for your project.

    [Enable billing][billing]

1.  Enable the Stackdriver Error Reporting API.

    [Enable the API][enable_api]

1.  [Set up authentication with a service account][auth] so you can access the
    API from your local workstation.

[projects]: https://console.cloud.google.com/project
[billing]: https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6293499#enable-billing
[enable_api]: https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=clouderrorreporting.googleapis.com
[auth]: https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started

### Prerequisites

1. Your application needs to use Node.js version 4.x or greater.

1. The module will only send errors when the `NODE_ENV` environment variable is
set to `production` or the `ignoreEnvironmentCheck` property given in the
runtime configuration object is set to `true`.  See the [Configuration](#configuration) section for more details.

### Installing the client library

    npm install --save @google-cloud/error-reporting

### Using the client library

```javascript
  // Imports the Google Cloud client library

  // Node 6+
  const {ErrorReporting} = require('@google-cloud/error-reporting');

  // Node 4+
  // const ErrorReporting = require('@google-cloud/error-reporting').ErrorReporting;

  // Using ES6 style imports via TypeScript or Babel
  // import {ErrorReporting} from '@google-cloud/error-reporting';

  // Instantiates a client
  const errors = new ErrorReporting({
    serviceContext: {service: 'my-service'} // not needed on Google Cloud
  });

  // Reports a simple error
  errors.report('Something broke!');

  // We also provide error handling middleware for express, hapi, restify & koa.
  // See sections below.
```

Open Stackdriver Error Reporting at [https://console.cloud.google.com/errors](https://console.cloud.google.com/errors) to view the reported errors.

## Samples

Samples are in the [`samples/`](https://github.com/googleapis/nodejs-error-reporting/blob/master/samples) directory. The samples' `README.md`
has instructions for running the samples.

| Sample                      | Source Code                       |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Examples | [source code](https://github.com/googleapis/nodejs-error-reporting/blob/master/samples/snippets.js) |

The [Error Reporting Node.js Client API Reference][client-docs] documentation
also contains samples.

## Examples

### Reporting Manually

```js
// Node 6+
const {ErrorReporting} = require('@google-cloud/error-reporting');
const errors = new ErrorReporting();

// Use the error message builder to customize all fields ...
const errorEvt = errors.event()
                     .setMessage('My error message')
                     .setUser('root@nexus');
errors.report(errorEvt, () => console.log('done!'));

// or just use a regular error ...
errors.report(new Error('My error message'), () => console.log('done!'));

// or one can even just use a string.
errors.report('My error message');
```

The stack trace associated with an error can be viewed in the error reporting console.
* If the `errors.report` method is given an `ErrorMessage` object built using the `errors.event` method, the stack trace at the point where the error event was constructed will be used.
* If the `errors.report` method is given an `Error` object, the stack trace where the error was instantiated will be used.
* If the `errors.report` method is given a string, the stack trace at the point where `errors.report` is invoked will be used.

### Using Express

```js
const express = require('express');

// Node 6+
const {ErrorReporting} = require('@google-cloud/error-reporting');
const errors = new ErrorReporting();

const app = express();

app.get('/error', (req, res, next) => {
  res.send('Something broke!');
  next(new Error('Custom error message'));
});

app.get('/exception', () => {
  JSON.parse('{\"malformedJson\": true');
});

// Note that express error handling middleware should be attached after all
// the other routes and use() calls. See [express docs][express-error-docs].
app.use(errors.express);

app.listen(3000);
```

### Using Hapi

```js
const hapi = require('hapi');

// Node 6+
const {ErrorReporting} = require('@google-cloud/error-reporting');
const errors = new ErrorReporting();

const server = new hapi.Server();
server.connection({ port: 3000 });
server.start();

server.route({
  method: 'GET',
  path: '/error',
  handler: (request, reply) => {
    reply('Something broke!');
    throw new Error('Custom error message');
  }
});

server.register(errors.hapi);
```

### Using Koa

```js
const Koa = require('koa');

// Node 6+
const {ErrorReporting} = require('@google-cloud/error-reporting');
const errors = new ErrorReporting();

const app = new Koa();

app.use(errors.koa);

app.use(function *(next) {
  //This will set status and message
  this.throw('Error Message', 500);
});

// response
app.use(function *(){
  this.body = 'Hello World';
});

app.listen(3000);
```

### Using Restify

```js
const restify = require('restify');

// Node 6+
const {ErrorReporting} = require('@google-cloud/error-reporting');
const errors = new ErrorReporting();

function respond(req, res, next) {
  next(new Error('this is a restify error'));
}

const server = restify.createServer();

server.use(errors.restify(server));
server.get('/hello/:name', respond);
server.head('/hello/:name', respond);

server.listen(3000);
```

## Configuration

The following code snippet lists all available configuration options.  All configuration options are optional.

```js
// Node 6+
const {ErrorReporting} = require('@google-cloud/error-reporting');
const errors = new ErrorReporting({
  projectId: 'my-project-id',
  keyFilename: '/path/to/keyfile.json',
  credentials: require('./path/to/keyfile.json'),
  // if true library will attempt to report errors to the service regardless
  // of the value of NODE_ENV
  // defaults to false
  ignoreEnvironmentCheck: false,
  // determines the logging level internal to the library; levels range 0-5
  // where 0 indicates no logs should be reported and 5 indicates all logs
  // should be reported
  // defaults to 2 (warnings)
  logLevel: 2,
  // determines whether or not unhandled rejections are reported to the
  // error-reporting console
  reportUnhandledRejections: true,
  serviceContext: {
      service: 'my-service',
      version: 'my-service-version'
  }
});
```

## Unhandled Rejections

Unhandled Rejections are not reported by default.  The reporting of unhandled rejections can be enabled using the `reportUnhandledRejections` configuration option.  See the [Configuration](#configuration) section for more details.

If unhandled rejections are set to be reported, then, when an unhandled rejection occurs, a message is printed to standard out indicated that an unhandled rejection had occurred and is being reported, and the value causing the rejection is reported to the error-reporting console.

## Catching and Reporting Application-wide Uncaught Errors

Uncaught exceptions are not reported by default.  *It is recommended to process `uncaughtException`s for production-deployed applications.*

Note that uncaught exceptions are not reported by default because to do so would require adding a listener to the `uncaughtException` event.  Adding such a listener without knowledge of other `uncaughtException` listeners can cause interference between the event handlers or prevent the process from terminating cleanly.  As such, it is necessary for `uncaughtException`s to be reported manually.

```js
// Node 6+
const {ErrorReporting} = require('@google-cloud/error-reporting');
const errors = new ErrorReporting();
process.on('uncaughtException', (e) => {
  // Write the error to stderr.
  console.error(e);
  // Report that same error the Stackdriver Error Service
  errors.report(e);
});
```

More information about uncaught exception handling in Node.js and what it means for your application can be found [here](https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#process_event_uncaughtexception).

## Running on Google Cloud Platform

All information in this section assumes that the items in the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section above have been completed.

### Google App Engine Flexible environment

If you are using [Google App Engine flexible environment](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/), you do not have to do any additional configuration.

### Google Compute Engine

Your VM instances need to be created with the `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform` scope if created via the [gcloud](https://cloud.google.com/sdk) CLI or the Google Cloud Platform API, or by enabling at least one of the Stackdriver APIs if created through the browser-based console.

If you already have VMs that were created without API access and do not wish to recreate it, you can follow the instructions for using a service account under [running elsewhere](#running-elsewhere).

### Google Container Engine

As with Compute Engine, Container Engine nodes need to be created with the `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform` scope, which is configurable during cluster creation:
* If the cluster is being created with the `gcloud` CLI, pass the scope to the command with the `--scopes` command (multiple scopes can be [delimited with a comma](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/container/clusters/create)):

  ```sh
  gcloud container clusters create example-cluster-name --scopes https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform
  ```

* If the cluster is being created through the Cloud Console UI, ensure that the "Cloud Platform" project access is set to "Enabled" (it's disabled by default).

Alternatively, you can also follow the instructions for using a service account under [running elsewhere](#running-elsewhere). It's recommended that you store the service account credentials as [Kubernetes Secret](http://kubernetes.io/v1.1/docs/user-guide/secrets.html).

## Running Elsewhere

If your application is running outside of Google Cloud Platform, such as locally, on-premise, or on another cloud provider, you can still use Stackdriver Errors either with locally-stored credentials or with an API Key.

### Using Locally-Stored Credentials

1. You will need to specify your project ID when starting the errors agent.

    ```sh
    GCLOUD_PROJECT=particular-future-12345 node myapp.js
    ```

1. You need to provide service account credentials to your application by using one of the three options below:
  * The recommended way is via [Application Default Credentials][app-default-credentials].
    1. [Create a new JSON service account key][service-account].
    1. Copy the key somewhere your application can access it. Be sure not to expose the key publicly.
    1. Set the environment variable `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` to the full path to the key. The Error Reporting library will automatically look for this environment variable.
  * If you are running your application on a development machine or test environment where you are using the [`gcloud` command line tools][gcloud-sdk], and are logged using `gcloud beta auth application-default login`, you already have sufficient credentials, and a service account key is not required.
  * Alternatively, you may set the `keyFilename` or `credentials` configuration field to the full path or contents to the key file, respectively. Setting either of these fields will override either setting `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` or logging in using `gcloud`. For example:

    ```js
    // Node 6+
    const {ErrorReporting} = require('@google-cloud/error-reporting');
    // Require and start the agent with configuration options
    const errors = new ErrorReporting({
      // The path to your key file:
      keyFilename: '/path/to/keyfile.json',

      // Or the contents of the key file:
      credentials: require('./path/to/keyfile.json')
    });
    ```

When running on Google Cloud Platform, we handle these for you automatically.

### Using an API Key

You may use an API key in lieu of locally-stored credentials. Please see [this document][api-key] on how to set up an API key if you do not already have one.

Once you have obtained an API key, you may provide it as part of the Error Reporting instance configuration:

```js
// Node 6+
const {ErrorReporting} = require('@google-cloud/error-reporting');
const errors = new ErrorReporting({
  projectId: '{your project ID}',
  key: '{your api key}'
});
```

If a key is provided, the module will not attempt to authenticate using the methods associated with locally-stored credentials as mentioned in the previous section.

We recommend using a file, environment variable, or another mechanism to store the API key rather than hard-coding it into your application's source.

**Note:** The Error Reporting instance will check if the provided API key is invalid shortly after it is instantiated. If the key is invalid, an error-level message will be logged to stdout.

## Versioning

This library follows [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

This library is considered to be in **beta**. This means it is expected to be
mostly stable while we work toward a general availability release; however,
complete stability is not guaranteed. We will address issues and requests
against beta libraries with a high priority.
